## 💡 What I Learned

Building this project was a great dive into modern JavaScript architecture and front-end tooling. Here are the key things I learned:

* **Webpack Configuration:** I learned how to set up Webpack from scratch and create separate configurations for `development` (with a live dev-server) and `production` (optimized for deployment).
* **Local Storage:** I implemented browser `localStorage` so that user data persists even after refreshing the page or closing the tab.
* **Working with JSON:** I learned how to use `JSON.stringify()` to convert JavaScript objects/arrays into text for storage, and `JSON.parse()` to turn them back into usable data.
* **Class Rehydration:** I tackled the challenge of losing Object-Oriented Class methods when saving to JSON, and learned how to "rehydrate" plain data back into functional Class instances when loading the app.
* **DOM Manipulation:** Keeping the UI strictly separated from the application's underlying data logic.
